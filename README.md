## Using the Content

TODO

## Chapter Contents

Lecture content consists of slides and demos.
Slides are written in [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and use [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) and [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) to render HTML output.
Lecture slides are built from the `slides.md` file using the `make` command (and the `Makefile`).
Demos are snippets of code and support files that showcase concepts and ideas related to the lecture.
Demos are located in the `demo/` folder.
Each demo has its own folder with source code, `Makefile` or other build files (if required) and support files.

Lab content consists of lab text and lab activities.
Lab text is placed in the `README.md` file.
Each lab activity has its own folder with source code, `Makefile` or other build files (if required) and support files.
